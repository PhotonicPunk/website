If you know, you know.

"Hello World" is traditionally the first program a beginner writes when learning a new programming language. For me, that rite of passage came in the 1970s, when as a young boy I was given an amazing toy: the Logix 0-600 Electronic Computer, made by Logix Enterprises in Montreal.

I'll save the details for a future post, but let's just say from this moment on I was hooked, and computers soon became an indispensable part of my life.

This blog is my space to write about the ups and downs of my entrepreneurial journey. I've been an entrepreneur for over two decades, founding companies, building advanced research labs from scratch, leading applied R&D teams, and learning lessons the hard way. Some of those lessons were expensive. A few were painful. All had a role to play in shaping me into the entrepreneur I am today.

Along the way, I expect to wander into science, innovation, leadership, travel, music, Dungeons & Dragons, and whatever else catches my fancy. I've never been particularly good at staying in one lane.

If any of that sounds interesting, pull up a chair. There's a lot to talk about.
