# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights gathered over 20+ years in applied research and development, entrepreneurship, and innovation.

## What to Expect

Here, I'll be writing about:

- **Science** - From my work in infrared spectroscopy to holography, I'll share accessible explanations of complex topics
- **Entrepreneurship** - Lessons learned from founding and building companies like Picomole and Valaista Health
- **Innovation** - Insights on bringing technologies from the lab to market
- **Leadership** - Thoughts on building and mentoring multidisciplinary teams

## A Bit About Me

I'm an experimental physicist with a PhD from the University of Toronto. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on some fascinating technologies:

- Non-invasive breath analysis for detecting lung cancer
- Holographic displays for wearable technology
- Metamaterial optical filters for aerospace applications
- Atmospheric spectroscopy and climate research

I've founded companies, led R&D teams, and worked with everyone from startups to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

## Why Now?

After years of focusing on building things, I feel it's time to share some of what I've learned. Whether you're a scientist, entrepreneur, or just curious about how technology moves from idea to reality, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out if there are topics you'd like me to cover.
